# Geant4Tutorials
============================
Geant4 tutorials made by Steven Walton:

I will be making videos for these at well. 
We will go through tutorials and build our first Geant4 application, step by step
First we will get a basic geometry, then get a visualization where we can run a beam through it, then we will focus on the physics

--------------------------------------
I am not an expert at Geant, this is both to help me learn and to help others that have the same problems as me. I welcome emails from others that would like to correct me and help with this. I am doing this because most of the information on Geant I see out there suggests that one should just review the examples and just dive in to making an application from there.

It is my belief that one should be able to se and make and understand what is the bare essentials before building more complex ones. Going through the examples there are a lot of different ways of doing things and I am trying to piece together the parts from the Geant4 User's Guide (can be found at http://geant4.web.cern.ch/geant4/UserDocumentation/UsersGuides/ForApplicationDeveloper/fo/BookForAppliDev.pdf). Please reference this material, as it has much more information than I will include. The point of this is just to get your feet wet.

Remember that if you would like to add more options (such as data, graphics libraries, or multithreading) you can just run the cmake in your build directory and add them. 

Standard Options are located on page 17 of this document (section 2.3.1). Please read it
